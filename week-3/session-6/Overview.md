We started out by looking at a few different solutions for the [*One, potato*](https://github.com/BurlingtonCodeAcademy/jsah-june-2021-notes/blob/main/week-3/session-5/labs/one_potato.md) lab. We took a deep dive into input/output and how NodeJS can accept input from the user. This included learning about callback functions, asynchronous programming and finally writing some interactive programs.
