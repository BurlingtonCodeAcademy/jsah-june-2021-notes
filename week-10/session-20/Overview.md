We've made it to the final day of JSAH class! We started class reviewing the [**Flexbox Block Lab**](https://codepen.io/burlingtoncodeacademy/pen/KKmJPGJ) and talking through some of the [**Flexbox Froggy**](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) game.
<br/>

We spend the majority of class wrapping everything we've learned together with DOM Scripting! We now have the skills to create interactive webpages that use JavaScript to respond to user actions. Check out the resource page on [The DOM](https://github.com/BurlingtonCodeAcademy/jsah-june-2021-notes/blob/main/resources-0/the-DOM.md) for more references.

## Practice

Here are a handful of labs on DOM scripting:
