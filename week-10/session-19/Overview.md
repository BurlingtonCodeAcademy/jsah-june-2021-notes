We started class by sharing some examples of our webpages and got to meet a few pets and learn a little bit about your favorite books, movies, and people you admire while exploring new css techniques and styling. Thanks for sharing!

<br>

We touched briefly on web page accessibility and discussed the [**A11y Project**](https://www.a11yproject.com/). Check out the link for more information and details!

<br>

The majority of class we talked about webpage layout using a variety of CSS tools including **Flexbox**. You can practice using Flexbox in this [Flexbox playground](https://codepen.io/burlingtoncodeacademy/pen/wvKRojY) in codepen.

## Homework
* [**Flexbox Block Lab**](https://codepen.io/burlingtoncodeacademy/pen/KKmJPGJ)
    * play around with the [Flexbox playground](https://codepen.io/burlingtoncodeacademy/pen/wvKRojY) before tackling this lab
    * you will not need to change any of the HTML to accomplish the task
    * practice placing all styles in the separate CSS file instead of using inline styles within your HTML
    * you can copy the codepen code into VSCode files if you are more comfortable working in that environment
